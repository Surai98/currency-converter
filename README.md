# currency-converter
 This is a currency converter which I created using html,css and javascript.   The program allows the user to add and delete different currencies from different currencies and also set the base currency to be used in calculating and converting the currencies. I used the foreign exchange api to get the different currency rates and also set the date. 
 This is an independent project which I took after  learning how to use javascript.
